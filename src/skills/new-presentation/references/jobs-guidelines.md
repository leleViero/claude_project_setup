**AI Presentation Guideline: Steve Jobs's 3-Second Rule for Elegant Presentation**

This document outlines the core principles of presentation design derived from the practices of Steve Jobs, specifically focusing on the "Billboard Test," or the 3-Second Rule. These guidelines are mandatory for all AI-generated presentation slides designed for live delivery, ensuring maximum audience retention, minimized cognitive load, and visual elegance.

### 1. Core Principle: The Billboard Test (The 3-Second Rule)

The guiding philosophy for slide creation is rooted in the "Billboard Test".

**1.1 Definition:** Presentation slides must be designed to be as easy to grasp as billboards. Highway billboards are designed to be read in about three to five seconds.

**1.2 Pass/Fail Criterion:** If a slide fails to convey its main point at a glance within three to five seconds, it contains too much information, typically too much text, too many images, or too many messages. The AI must ensure the primary message of a slide is immediately clear. If a slide cannot be read on a highway, it will not work over Zoom.

### 2. Rationale: Minimising Cognitive Load

The mandatory adherence to the Billboard Test is based on principles aimed at reducing the audience's mental effort and enhancing retention.

**2.1 Cognitive Load Theory:** **Cognitive load** is the amount of mental effort the human brain uses to process information. When a presenter delivers a slide cluttered with text, graphics, and charts while speaking at the same time, it overwhelms the audience. An overloaded slide forces the audience to split their attention, meaning they can focus on the speaker or the slide, but not both. Using bullet points on a slide, for example, is often distracting because of this concept called cognitive load.

**2.2 Attention and Retention:** Simple, clean designs are essential for improving focus and readability. Simplicity signals confidence and increases information retention. If a slide is convoluted or dense, especially on a small screen like a smartphone or iPad in a virtual presentation, the viewer will be "turned off".

### 3. AI Implementation Guidelines for Slide Generation

The AI must apply the following derived guidelines to ensure all live presentation slides meet the 3-Second Rule standard.

#### 3.1 Content Minimalism and Focus

1.  **One Idea Per Slide (Mandatory):** Each slide must focus on a single, core concept or idea. When multiple ideas are present, the slide should be split. Each slide should aim to have a single, strong headline stating the main takeaway.
2.  **Text Reduction:** Slides should primarily use keywords and short phrases, avoiding dense paragraphs or full sentences. The AI should aim for hyper-minimalist slides with only a few powerful words or a single image. Avoid having slides that resemble memos or documents.
3.  **Data Isolation:** When presenting quantitative information or charts, the AI must simplify the visual to highlight the single most important insight the audience should take away. Charts should not be a "data dump".
4.  **Separation of Genre:** The AI must recognize that slides are visual aids for live interaction ("the stage"), whereas documents or memos ("the screen") are meant to be read independently. If the audience requires more detail than can be delivered live, the AI should implement a **hybrid strategy** by suggesting a separate, factual 'leave-behind' or 'pre-read' document. Bullet points are acceptable in documents (like emails) because they make material easier to scan, but they are often distracting on presentation slides.

#### 3.2 Visual Design and Readability

1.  **Visual Prominence:** Slides should feature large, impactful visuals that support the spoken message. Visual elements must serve a purpose, and generic or low-quality stock photos should be avoided as they suggest a lack of professionalism and dilute the information.
2.  **Font Size and Limitation:** The AI must enforce a minimum font size to prevent crowding the slide. For persuasive presentations like investor pitches, no font smaller than **30 points** should be used. Body text should generally be no smaller than 24 points to ensure readability, especially from the back of the room.
3.  **Embrace White Space (Negative Space):** The design must incorporate ample negative space. White space provides mental "breathing room," reduces cognitive load, improves readability, and draws the audience's eye to the most critical information.
4.  **High Contrast:** The design must utilize high-contrast colour schemes (e.g., light text on a dark blue background) to ensure optimal legibility.

#### 3.3 The Presenter's Role (Storytelling and Delivery)

1.  **Focus on Storytelling:** The slides must complement the speaker's story; the speaker is the storyteller, not the slides. The AI should encourage the presentation to be structured like a compelling story.
2.  **Practice Emphasis:** Slides must be designed so the speaker uses them as a visual aid, not a script to be read verbatim. The AI should encourage users to practice until they know the material well enough to speak conversationally, ensuring that the presenter's cognitive resources are free to focus on connection with the audience.

### 4. Benchmark: The Steve Jobs Example

Steve Jobs's communication habits, distilled by experts, demonstrate the effectiveness of simplicity. He had the courage to keep his presentations simple, encompassing everything from using less jargon to maintaining minimalist slides.

*   **Aesthetic Standard:** Jobs's iconic presentations exemplify the masterful use of negative space, focusing on a single message or feature to emphasize exclusivity and clarity.
*   **The Billboard Test:** Jobs understood that presentation slides should be as easy to grasp as highway billboards. This is why his slides, such as those used for the iPhone launch, were designed to convey their meaning almost instantly.
