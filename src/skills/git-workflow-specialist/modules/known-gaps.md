# Known Gaps & Validation Tasks

## Open Items
- ⏳ Research large-scale monorepo workflows (Google Piper-inspired, Meta Sapling) for inclusion.
- ⏳ Evaluate Git with large binaries/WASM packages and document best practices beyond Git LFS.
- ⏳ Assess secure signing approaches (Sigstore gitsign) adoption patterns.

## TODOs
1. Pilot merge queue rollout with metrics dashboard and publish case study.
2. Build example repo demonstrating trunk-based + release branch hybrid including automation scripts.
3. Document process for compliance audits (SOX/ISO) with evidence templates.

## Notes
- Increase confidence to **high** after monorepo and compliance case studies complete.
- Monitor Git release cadence for new features (e.g., partial clones, scalar improvements) impacting guidance.*** End Patch
