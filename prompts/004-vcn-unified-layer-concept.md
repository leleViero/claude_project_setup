Generate a single, high-impact technology concept illustration representing a unified data portability layer that seamlessly connects separate company ecosystems. The image must have a TRANSPARENT background (alpha channel, PNG with no background fill).

COLOR PALETTE — Use ONLY this warm gradient palette across the entire composition:
- Primary: Deep indigo/purple (#4A1A8A to #6B3FA0)
- Secondary: Warm coral/orange (#E8734A to #F4A261)
- Accent gradient: Purple-to-orange transitions for borders and connecting elements
- Fills: Frosted white/translucent fills inside badge containers (glassmorphism-lite)
- Subtle tints: 10-20% opacity washes of primary and secondary for soft glows behind key elements
- Text: Dark indigo (#2D1B69) for all labels
- Do NOT introduce any colors outside this palette

COMPOSITION — Two-tier layout on a 2:1 landscape canvas:

UPPER SECTION (65% of canvas height) — THE SOLUTION: UNIFIED DATA LAYER

Three main badge-node elements arranged horizontally with a central connecting element:

LEFT NODE — COMPANY A:
- Container shape: Rounded hexagon badge with a soft purple-to-indigo gradient border (2-3px stroke), frosted semi-transparent white fill inside
- Interior icon: Minimal line-art depicting a small cluster of data elements — a simplified database cylinder, a tiny API bracket symbol, and a small monitor/screen — all drawn in thin indigo strokes
- Below the badge: Clean sans-serif label "Company A" in dark indigo

RIGHT NODE — COMPANY B:
- Container shape: Rounded square badge with soft coral-to-orange gradient border (2-3px stroke), frosted semi-transparent white fill inside
- Interior icon: Minimal line-art depicting a mirrored data ecosystem cluster — a simplified database cylinder, a document/file icon, and a small monitor/screen — all drawn in thin coral/orange strokes
- Below the badge: Clean sans-serif label "Company B" in dark indigo

CENTER ELEMENT — THE UNIFIED LAYER (the hero/focal point, slightly larger than the side nodes):
- Container shape: Circle badge with a full purple-to-orange gradient border (3-4px stroke, gradient flows left-purple to right-orange), frosted semi-transparent white fill
- Interior icon: A minimal bridge or infinity-loop symbol combined with a shield outline, representing seamless connectivity + privacy + transparency. Drawn with a gradient stroke matching the border (purple on left, orange on right). The bridge/infinity loop should feel fluid and continuous, not rigid
- Below the badge: Clean sans-serif label "Unified Data Layer" in dark indigo, slightly bolder than the side labels

CONNECTING LINES between the three nodes:
- Thin elegant lines (1-2px) connecting Company A → Unified Layer → Company B
- Lines use the same purple-to-orange gradient, flowing naturally from left to right
- Small directional arrows or data-flow dots along the lines suggesting bidirectional, seamless data movement
- Lines should curve gently (not straight), giving an organic, flowing feel

Above the three nodes, a subtle arching thin line or gentle arc connects Company A to Company B through the center, reinforcing the "bridge" metaphor. This arc should be very light (15-20% opacity), almost decorative.

LOWER SECTION (35% of canvas height) — THE OLD WAY (CROSSED OUT / DEPRECATED):

A horizontal row of three small badge elements showing the painful legacy process, visually "struck through" or faded to indicate this is the OLD, broken approach:

STEP 1 — RECODE:
- Small circular badge with a muted, desaturated purple border (40% opacity)
- Interior: Minimal icon of a code bracket or gear with a warning/error mark
- Label below: "Recode" in muted gray-indigo

STEP 2 — DUPLICATE:
- Small circular badge with a muted, desaturated border (40% opacity)
- Interior: Minimal icon of two overlapping database cylinders (duplication)
- Label below: "Duplicate" in muted gray-indigo

STEP 3 — STRIP HISTORY:
- Small circular badge with a muted, desaturated orange border (40% opacity)
- Interior: Minimal icon of a document with lines being erased or a clock with a strikethrough
- Label below: "Strip History" in muted gray-indigo

A single diagonal strikethrough line crosses through all three legacy steps — drawn in a soft red-coral (#E85A4F) at 50% opacity, indicating these painful steps are eliminated by the unified layer.

Small dashed arrows from the legacy row pointing UP toward the Unified Layer center badge, with a subtle label or visual cue suggesting "Replaced by" or simply an upward transformation arrow.

A thin horizontal separator line (very subtle, 10% opacity indigo) divides the upper solution section from the lower legacy section.

STYLE DIRECTIVES:
- Modern glassmorphism-lite aesthetic: badge containers have frosted glass fills (semi-transparent white with subtle blur effect), gradient borders, and very soft drop shadows (2-4px blur, 5-8% opacity black)
- Soft gradients on all borders — never flat solid colors. Gradients should feel warm and premium
- Clean, minimal line-art icons inside each badge — thin uniform strokes (1.5-2px), no filled shapes
- Typography: Modern geometric sans-serif (similar to Inter, Poppins, or SF Pro Display), consistent weight across all labels. "Unified Data Layer" label can be medium-weight, all others regular-weight
- Generous whitespace between all elements. The composition should breathe
- Grid-aligned, mathematically balanced spacing
- The upper section should feel vibrant, alive, and premium (the solution)
- The lower section should feel muted, faded, and deprecated (the old problem)
- This contrast between sections is critical to the visual storytelling

ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS:
- No background color, pattern, or gradient. Fully transparent PNG only
- No photorealism, no 3D rendering, no textures, no stock-photo aesthetic
- No busy details or cluttered compositions
- No decorative borders around the full image
- No watermarks
- No text other than the specified labels: "Company A", "Company B", "Unified Data Layer", "Recode", "Duplicate", "Strip History"
- No colors outside the specified palette
- No hard/sharp shadows — only very soft, barely-visible shadows if any

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- PNG with transparent background (alpha channel enabled)
- Resolution: 4096 x 2048 px (2:1 landscape ratio) or highest available resolution
- sRGB color space
- The entire composition should occupy roughly 75-85% of the canvas, centered, with balanced breathing room on all sides
- Upper section vertically centered in its zone, lower section vertically centered in its zone
