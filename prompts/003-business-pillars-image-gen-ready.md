Generate a single minimalistic, high-impact illustration representing three core business model pillars for use in a sales pitch and investor deck presentation. The image must have a TRANSPARENT background (alpha channel, PNG with no background fill).

Extract the dominant RGB color palette from the attached reference logo (logo.png). Use ONLY colors derived from this logo across the entire composition — primary brand color for key elements, secondary brand color for accents, and a lighter tint of the primary for subtle fills or glows. Do NOT introduce any colors outside the logo's palette.

Three distinct, evenly-spaced iconic pillars arranged horizontally in a balanced triptych composition, each representing one revenue stream:

PILLAR 1 — TRANSACTION FEES: A minimal, geometric coin or token with a subtle circular motion trail suggesting flow and exchange. Below the icon, a clean sans-serif label "Transaction Fees" in the brand's primary color.

PILLAR 2 — PARTNER SUBSCRIPTIONS: Two minimal abstract human silhouettes or nodes connected by a recurring loop or infinity-style ribbon, symbolizing ongoing partnership and recurring revenue. Below the icon, a clean sans-serif label "Partner Subscriptions" in the brand's primary color.

PILLAR 3 — INTELLIGENT LAYER: A minimal stylized brain or neural-network node cluster with 3-5 interconnected dots and lines, representing AI-driven intelligence. Below the icon, a clean sans-serif label "Intelligent Layer" in the brand's primary color.

Layout: Three pillars side by side, equal spacing, centered horizontally. Each pillar is a vertical stack with icon on top and label beneath. A subtle thin horizontal line connects all three pillars at their base, visually unifying them as parts of one system. A faint geometric shape (hexagon, circle, or rounded rectangle) behind each icon as a badge container, using a 10-15% opacity tint of the brand's secondary color. NO background. Fully transparent. The composition floats on alpha transparency.

Style: Flat vector, minimalistic, corporate-clean. No gradients, no 3D, no photorealism, no textures. Uniform thin-to-medium strokes. Swiss/International design aesthetic — grid-aligned, mathematically balanced, generous whitespace between pillars. Typography: modern geometric sans-serif (similar to Montserrat, Inter, or Helvetica Neue), consistent across all three labels. NO decorative elements, shadows, drop shadows, or glow effects. NO background color, pattern, or gradient. Transparent PNG output only.

Output format: PNG with transparent background (alpha channel enabled). Resolution: 4096 x 2048 px (2:1 landscape ratio) or highest available resolution. sRGB color space. The entire composition should occupy roughly 70-80% of the canvas width, centered, with breathing room on all sides.

No background color. No white background. No gradients. No 3D rendering. No photorealism. No stock-photo style. No busy details. No overlapping elements. No decorative borders. No watermarks. No text other than the three pillar labels. No colors outside the logo palette.
