# Solar Panel Parametric Orientation — Image Generation Prompts

**Use case:** Minimalistic diagram for company capability showcase (presentation slide / brochure insert)
**Concept:** Parametric tools automatically orienting 3D solar panel models to optimal position based on sun path analysis at design stage
**Palette:** Deep navy (#1B2A4A) + Warm amber (#E8A020) on white

## Prompt 1 — Precise Technical Diagram
**Best for:** Midjourney

Isometric technical diagram on a pure white background, showing three flat rectangular solar panels mounted on a minimal flat-roof geometry, each panel rendered at a different tilt angle along a shared pivot axis, the leftmost panel in thin dashed navy outline (wireframe, unoptimized position), the rightmost panel in solid deep navy fill (optimized position), connected by a thin amber rotation arc with arrowhead indicating angular sweep; above the scene, a large clean amber curved arc spanning the upper third of the composition represents the sun path trajectory, with three evenly spaced small circle nodes along it indicating sun positions; fine dashed plumb lines drop from each sun node toward the corresponding panel tilt angle, illustrating parametric alignment; a subtle isometric grid in 5% gray covers the base plane; linework is 1pt weight throughout; generous white negative space; no text, no shadows, no gradients, no texture; deep navy (#1B2A4A) and warm amber (#E8A020) two-color palette only; 16:9 aspect ratio, centered composition, clean focal hierarchy from arc to panels to pivot markers

**Negative prompt:** photorealism, textures, gradients, shadows, people, landscape, solar farm, construction, labels, annotations, decorative illustration, watercolor, sketch, complex background, green color, red color

## Prompt 2 — Minimal Isometric Parametric Logic
**Best for:** DALL-E 3

Minimalistic isometric line-art diagram, white background, depicting two rectangular flat solar panels on a simple geometric base plane shown in light gray thin-line isometric grid; one panel rendered as a dashed wireframe outline at a low tilt angle, one panel rendered as a solid flat shape at a steeper optimized tilt angle; a single clean curved arc in warm amber sweeps across the upper portion of the image representing a sun path, with a small filled circle at the apex; thin precise dashed construction lines connect the arc apex to the optimized panel surface normal, indicating parametric orientation logic; a small rotation pivot marker (open circle with arc arrow) sits at the panel base; flat graphic style, zero texture, zero shadow, 1pt uniform linework, deep navy and amber two-tone palette on white, architectural drawing aesthetic, ample negative space, no labels

**Negative prompt:** gradients, drop shadows, 3D rendering, photorealism, greenery, people, building interiors, solar installation photography, decorative elements, more than two accent colors, any text

## Prompt 3 — Abstract Parametric Symbol
**Best for:** Stable Diffusion

Ultra-minimal flat vector-style diagram on a white background; a large clean arc in warm amber (#E8A020) curves across the top half of a square composition, representing a sun trajectory; below the arc, a single rectangular panel form in deep navy (#1B2A4A) is shown tilted at an angle, with a thin dashed line extending from its face toward the arc apex to imply angular alignment; a small concentric-circle rotation indicator marks the pivot point at the panel base; the entire composition uses only straight lines, a single arc, and one rectangle; extreme negative space; no grid, no secondary panels, no background elements; 1pt linework throughout; the diagram reads as a pure symbol of solar orientation logic; balanced centered layout within a square or 16:9 frame

**Negative prompt:** photorealism, complexity, multiple objects, gradients, color fills beyond two colors, texture, labels, people, landscape, decorative flourishes, any style resembling illustration or painting

## Notes

- **Start with Prompt 1** — the wireframe/solid contrast cleanly tells the parametric "before → after" story
- All prompts intentionally contain no in-image text; labels should be added in the slide deck
- Prompts are ordered from most detailed (1) to most symbolic (3) — use #3 as an icon/thumbnail variant
