<objective>
Generate a single minimalistic, high-impact illustration representing three core business model pillars for use in a sales pitch / investor deck presentation. The image must have a TRANSPARENT background (alpha channel / PNG with no background fill).
</objective>

<color_palette>
Extract the dominant RGB color palette from the attached reference logo (logo.png). Use ONLY colors derived from this logo across the entire composition — primary brand color for key elements, secondary brand color for accents, and a lighter tint of the primary for subtle fills or glows. Do NOT introduce any colors outside the logo's palette.

Three distinct, evenly-spaced iconic pillars arranged horizontally in a balanced triptych composition, each representing one revenue stream:

PILLAR 1 — TRANSACTION FEES
- Icon: A minimal, geometric coin or token with a subtle circular motion trail suggesting flow and exchange.
- Below the icon: clean sans-serif label "Transaction Fees" in the brand's primary color.

PILLAR 2 — PARTNER SUBSCRIPTIONS
- Icon: Two minimal abstract human silhouettes or nodes connected by a recurring loop or infinity-style ribbon, symbolizing ongoing partnership and recurring revenue.
- Below the icon: clean sans-serif label "Partner Subscriptions" in the brand's primary color.

PILLAR 3 — INTELLIGENT LAYER
- Icon: A minimal stylized brain or neural-network node cluster with 3-5 interconnected dots and lines, representing AI-driven intelligence.
- Below the icon: clean sans-serif label "Intelligent Layer" in the brand's primary color.
</subject>

<visual_structure>
- Layout: Three pillars side by side, equal spacing, centered horizontally. Each pillar is a vertical stack: icon on top, label beneath.
- A subtle thin horizontal line or bar connects all three pillars at their base, visually unifying them as parts of one system.
- Optional: a faint geometric shape (hexagon, circle, or rounded rectangle) behind each icon as a badge container, using a 10-15% opacity tint of the brand's secondary color.
- NO background. Fully transparent. The composition floats on alpha transparency.
</visual_structure>

<style_directives>
- Style: Flat vector, minimalistic, corporate-clean. No gradients, no 3D, no photorealism, no textures.
- Line weight: Uniform thin-to-medium strokes (2-3px equivalent at 4K).
- Aesthetic: Swiss/International design — grid-aligned, mathematically balanced, generous whitespace between pillars.
- Typography: Modern geometric sans-serif (similar to Montserrat, Inter, or Helvetica Neue). All caps or sentence case — consistent across all three labels.
- NO decorative elements, shadows, drop shadows, or glow effects.
- NO background color, pattern, or gradient. Transparent PNG output only.
</style_directives>

<technical_specifications>
- Output format: PNG with transparent background (alpha channel enabled).
- Resolution: 4096 x 2048 px (2:1 landscape ratio) or highest available resolution.
- Color space: sRGB.
- The entire composition should occupy roughly 70-80% of the canvas width, centered, with breathing room on all sides.
</technical_specifications>
